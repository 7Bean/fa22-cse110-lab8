1). Within a Github action allows you to automate the testing while the other options do not, with a github action you can test everytime after you push code
2). No, end-to-end testing means you are testing the entirety of the code and how everything works together which is not suitable if you only want to test a single function
3). No, the message feature is part of a larger moving application and to test this you would also need to look at if a user can recieve the message also 
4). Yes, the max message length can be encapsulated and seperate from other components you can just test if the text input is limited properly
